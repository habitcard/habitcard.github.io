It helps you reflect, grow, and understand your life better with every entry.\n\nThere are several journal types to suit your style. Gratitude journaling boosts positivity by noting things you’re thankful for. Art journaling mixes drawings and words for creative expression. Bullet journaling organizes tasks with lists and symbols. Junk journaling uses random items like tickets for a messy, fun vibe. Travel journaling captures adventures with notes and mementos. Each type offers a unique way to connect with yourself.",
